# QuizBot

QuizBot is an application that is lightweight and uses Twillio’s SMS features. It does one thing – it engages users with quizzes. The inspiration for this is marketing. Picture yourself sitting in a waiting room or in an exam room at your doctor’s office. Printed on a poster stuck to the wall, you read “Find out more about your risks of heart disease. Text HEART to xxx-xxx-xxxx to test your knowledge about heart disease.”

In addition to entertaining patients at the point of service, it gives you the opportunity to combine these opted-in users into other campaigns further down the road.

## Things You Will Need to Get Started
Before you can do anything, you will need to open an account with Twilio. The trial version is free. Here is a small demo on signing up, choosing a number and a brief description on SMS inbound and outbound. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SLdV8dn7_I

Keep in mind that while you are setting up, configuring and testing this application all of your text messages from this trial account to users will be prepended by: “Sent from your Twilio trail account – “.
