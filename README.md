# QuizBot

This application is a light weight Sinatra app that uses Twilio’s SMS features and it does one thing, engage users with quizzes. The inspiration for this is marketing. Picture yourself sitting in a waiting room or in an exam room at your doctor’s office. Printed on a poster stuck to the wall, you read “Find out more about your risks of heart disease. Text HEART to xxx-xxx-xxxx to test your knowledge about heart disease.” 

In addition to entertaining patients at the point of service, it gives you the opportunity to combine these opted-in users into other campaigns further down the road.
